- Creates a static map of sample sites using tmap package
- Saves map as a '.rds' object in output/ folder

`code/Table.R`
- Imports data from '.rds' file saved in output
- Mutates data to sort my phycocyanin levels 
- Uses gtsummary to make table of algal colony counts 
- Saves table as a '.rds' object in output/ folder
- ***required table***

`code/Graph.R`
- Imports data from '.rds' file saved in output
- Creates plot of "Microcystis vs Phycocyanin"

- Saves plots in '.rds' object in output/ folder
- ***required figure***

`code/Regression.R`
- Imports data from '.rds' file saved in output

- Uses gtsummary to display regression results in table for each algal species
- Saves two regression tables in '.rds' object in output/ folder

`Report.Rmd`
- Loads cleaned data and configuration parameters
